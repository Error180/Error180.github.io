	<h2 id="Childhood" style="color:brown">Childhood Years</h2>
	<div align="justify">
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my childhood, I used to quite the troublemaker<sup><b>1</b></sup>. Like other children 
	my age, I was very carefree<sup><b>2</b></sup>. I spent most of my time outside the my house and I even played with my neighbors 
	and friends<sup><b>3</b></sup>. I got into all manners of mischief<sup><b>4</b></sup>. There are even times when I quarreled with 
	my sibling<sup><b>5</b></sup>. Both of my parents worked in order to maked ends meet<sup><b>6</b></sup>. My father worked in the 
	<strong><i>Developement Bank of the Philippines</i></strong> in <b>Makati City</b><sup><b>7</b></sup>. My mother, on the other hand, 
	worked in the <strong><i>University of the East</i></strong> in <b>Metro Manila</b><sup><b>8</b></sup>. Since our house was built in 
	<b>Antipolo City</b>, we often stayed at my grandmother's house in <b>San Juan City</b><sup>whenever I needed to attend school in St. Johns Academy<b>9</b></sup>. We only returned during 
	the weekends<sup><b>10</b></sup>. 

	<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living in the house, along with my grandmother, were my other relatives<sup><b>11</b></sup>. They worked 
	together when tackling problems<sup><b>12</b></sup>. They took care of me while my parents were busy at work<sup><b>13</b></sup>. I had 
	a lot of people who took care of me so I never felt lonely<sup><b>14</b></sup>. It wouldn't even be too far to say that I spent most of 
	my childhood living with my grandmother and other relatives<sup><b>15</b></sup>. As a child things always looked bright<sup><b>16</b></sup>. 
	The simplest of family gatherings were always enough to excite me<sup><b>17</b></sup>. Learning new things was also a unique experience
	<sup><b>18</b></sup>. Even having dreams seemed simple yet exciting<sup><b>19</b></sup>. I once even dreamed of becoming a pilot and 
	travelling the world<sup><b>20</b></sup>.</p>

	<div align="justify">
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I reached my teenage years, I realized a lot of things<sup><b>1</b></sup>. I realized that things 
	are not always as simple as they seem<sup><b>2</b></sup>. I learned that in order to become a functioning member of society, I needed 
	to gain more knowledge and experiences<sup><b>3</b></sup>. I also learned that in order to achieve my dreams, I needed to work hard for 
	it <sup><b>4</b></sup>. Which is why I decided to try harder<sup><b>5</b></sup>. I continued to study in <strong><i>St. John's Academy</i></strong>, 
	a private school, in <b>San Juan City</b><sup><b>6</b></sup>. I increasingly became very busy with my studies<sup><b>7</b></sup>. 
	
	<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The free time that I once spent relaxing leisurely needed to be spent on studies as well as maintaining my 
	grades instead<sup><b>8</b></sup>. In order to further improve my academical activity, I decided to aim for the <strong><i>University of the 
	East</i></strong> for college<sup><b>9</b></sup>. I needed to learn the proper knowledge that I required in order to prepare for the future
	<sup><b>10</b></sup>. On top of that I also had to balance my schedule between various factors<sup><b>11</b></sup>. Two of these factors 
	are resting and studying<sup><b>12</b></sup>. Needing to balance my lifestyle while encountering various obstacles physically, mentally 
	and emotionally was not easy<sup><b>13</b></sup>. But through facing all this hardships, I was able to slowly mature<sup><b>14</b></sup>. 
	I became more aware of my surroundings<sup><b>15</b></sup>. I even started to observe others more than interacting with them
	<sup><b>16</b></sup>. I also became less lively and talkative<sup><b>17</b></sup>. I did this in order to improve my manners in preparation 
	for adulthood<sup><b>18</b></sup>. I became increasingly determined to improve<sup><b>19</b></sup>. Through every obstacle I faced I learned 
	that a person can't achieve any progress without putting in any serious effort<sup><b>20</b></sup>.</p>

	<h2 id="College" style="color:brown">College Years</h2>
	<div align="justify">
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I became a college student, I've already transferred to the <strong><i>University of the East</i></strong> 
	in <b>Manila</b><sup><b>1</b></sup>. But things didn't exactly get any easier<sup><b>2</b></sup>. I was expecting college to be  similar but 
	slightly easier than gradeschool<sup><b>3</b></sup>. This was because most of my experiences during my teenage years were had already prepared
	me for it<sup><b>4</b></sup>. But now I realized how different things actually are<sup><b>5</b></sup>. College turns out to be a whole new 
	experience entirely<sup><b>6</b></sup>. This became even more so when the <strong><i>Corona Virus</i></strong> appeared<sup><b>7</b></sup>. 
	Due to its occurrence, what everyone once considered as irregular became the new norm<sup><b>8</b></sup>. <b>Quarantines</b> were implemented 
	and face-to-face classes were indefinitely suspended<sup><b>9</b></sup>. In order to adapt to the situation, the majority of educational 
	institutions as well as various facilities resorted to online methods<sup><b>10</b></sup>. Various businesses and institutions that couldn't 
	adapt to online services even closed down<sup><b>11</b></sup>. Wearing <b>facemasks</b> outside even became required as well<sup><b>12</b></sup>. 
	
	<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various changes occurred that changed people perception<sup><b>13</b></sup>. But despite all these changes for everyone, 
	nothing really changed much in my lifestyle personally<sup><b>14</b></sup>. I'm not really as outgoing as others which allowed me to endure staying 
	indoors for longer periods of time<sup><b>15</b></sup>. I simply continued striving for improvement without too much issues<sup><b>16</b></sup>.Now 
	that I've finally reached this far, I now need to focus more on the bigger picture<sup><b>17</b></sup>. This is the part of my life where I 
	need to make big decisions which would impact my future and I can't be hindered by all these changes<sup><b>18</b></sup>. I have to decide 
	on my course based on my desired future occupation<sup><b>19</b></sup>. This is the part of my life where I decide my future<sup><b>20</b></sup>.</p>
