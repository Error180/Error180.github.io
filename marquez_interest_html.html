    <h2 style="color:brown;">Skills</h2>
    <div align="center">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When asked about what I'm good at, I often take my time answering<sup><b>1</b></sup>. 
        When it comes to this topic, I can't just answer halfheartedly<sup><b>2</b></sup>. I have to properly analyze my abilities
        through careful observation<sup><b>3</b></sup>. A person's skills determines their future occupation, how other people view
        them as well as how they view themselves<sup><b>4</b></sup>. Which is why I need to view myself objectively<sup><b>5</b></sup>.
        This way I can properly gauge my own capabilities or skills without exaggerating or belittling them<sup><b>6</b></sup>.

        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to my skills, I believe I am fairly good at <strong>observation</strong><sup><b>7</b></sup>. 
        When I was a child, I didn't often pay too much attention to my surroundings and I often acted without too much thought
        <sup><b>8</b></sup>. This was the reason why I was often considered as <strong>impulsive</strong> in the past<sup><b>9</b></sup>.
        So when I realized my mistakes, I decided to become more observant towards my surroundings and think before I act<sup><b>10</b></sup>.
        Another skill, which I learned in my day-to-day life, is <strong>organization</strong><sup><b>11</b></sup>. During my time in highschool,
        I developed this certain skill in order to adapt to a certain obstacle I faced which was <strong>time management</strong><sup><b>12</b></sup>. 
        In order to properly utilize my time and avoid wasted efforts, I often organized my schedule in a journal and followed it accordingly<sup><b>13</b></sup>. 
        By practicing this skill, I was able to spend most of my time meaningfully<sup><b>14</b></sup>. My third skill is my <strong>punctuality</strong><sup><b>15</b></sup>. 
        When it comes to doing my work, either in school or at home, I always make sure to have enough spare time in case of any unforseen events<sup><b>16</b></sup>. 
        Finally, my fourth and most relevant skill is the ability to <strong>utilize technology</strong><sup><b>17</b></sup>. Although some people may say that being 
        able to use technology isn't particularly special or rare, I consider myself lucky enough to be someone who does<sup><b>18</b></sup>. In the current modern age, 
        this particular skill will allow me to adapt to various technological advances as well as allow me to pursue an occupation that I am quite familiar 
        with<sup><b>19</b></sup>. I believe that all these skills make me who I am<sup><b>20</b></sup>.

    <h2 style="color:brown;">Hobbies</h2>
    <div align="center">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to my hobbies, I don't need to think too deeply<sup><b>1</b></sup>. 
        My hobbies are like <strong><i>second nature</i></strong> to me<sup><b>2</b></sup>. As such, stating and describing 
        them is incredibly simple<sup><b>3</b></sup>. My first hobby is obviously using a computer<sup><b>4</b></sup>. 
        I chose to pursue the <strong><i>IT</i></strong> course because of this particular hobby in the first place<sup><b>5</b></sup>. 
        My second hobby is travelling<sup><b>6</b></sup>. Whenever I have free time, I often convince my family to go to various places 
        to gaze at the sceneries<sup><b>7</b></sup>. But due to the spread of the <strong><i>Corona Virus</i></strong>, this particular 
        hobby had to be temporarily avoided<sup><b>8</b></sup>.
             
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outbreak of the <b>pandemic</b> completely altered our norms<sup><b>9</b></sup>. Due to the virus, 
        several hobbies of mine was affected<sup><b>10</b></sup>. Other than my hobby of travelling with my family being affected, 
        another hobby of mine, which was visiting coffee shops with my cousins, was also temporarily stopped<sup><b>11</b></sup>. 
        The implemmentation of the <b>quarantine</b> limited the amount of shops that were open as well as the amount of people that could 
        enter<sup><b>12</b></sup>. This caused me to halt all my outdoor hobbies and activities<sup><b>13</b></sup>. But in the process, 
        I ended up developing some new hobbies as well<sup><b>14</b></sup>. Due to being unable to leave my house, I also developed a 
        hobby of listening to music during my free time<sup><b>15</b></sup>. I also started to like cleaning and organizing around the 
        house<sup><b>16</b></sup>. When the things are back to normal, I'd like to continue where I left off<sup><b>17</b></sup>. I plan
        to, once again, continue traveling as well as visiting various cafes with my cousins<sup><b>18</b></sup>. I'll definitely mistakes
        up for lost time<sup><b>19</b></sup>. And who knows, I might discover some new hobbies as well<sup><b>20</b></sup>.

    <h2 style="color:brown;">Interests</h2>
    <div align="center">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it comes to describing my interests, just like my hobbies, I don't have to think too deeply 
        either<sup><b>1</b></sup>. <b><i>Hobbies</i></b> and <b><i>Interests</i></b> are closely related to each other after 
        all<sup><b>2</b></sup>. Although, unlike my hobbies, my interests often change depending on the situtation<sup><b>3</b></sup>. 
        Most of my interests from the past have changed while some have remained<sup><b>4</b></sup>. One of the interests, that I developed
        when I was a child and that I still have till this day, is my interest in computers as well as other types of technology<sup><b>5</b></sup>.
        <br><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first interest is obviously technology<sup><b>6</b></sup>. Due to having grown up around computers
        and an older cousin who often uses them, I've grown to be deeply fascinated by them along with other gadgets as well<sup><b>7</b></sup>.
        My deep interest in technology allowed me to develop a hobby in using computers<sup><b>8</b></sup>. It allowed me to pursue an occupation
        related to them as well<sup><b>9</b></sup>. It also played a huge part in helping me adapt to the current circumstances due to the 
        pandemic as well<sup><b>10</b></sup>. My second interest, which is drinking coffee also resulted in me developing a hobby as 
        well<sup><b>11</b></sup>. Due to this strong interest in the taste of various coffees, I developed the hobby of visiting cafes<sup><b>12</b></sup>.
        My third interest is travelling to places with beautiful sceneries<sup><b>13</b></sup>. One place that managed to captivate me was a certain
        beach in <strong><i>Mindoro</i></strong><sup><b>14</b></sup>. Another was a forest in <strong><i>Lucban</i></strong><sup><b>15</b></sup>. 
        Those two were places that I visited during my childhood<sup><b>16</b></sup>. I still haven't had the privelege to visit them a second 
        time<sup><b>17</b></sup>. I can barely remember their names but I can still remember the scenery that I saw vividly<sup><b>18</b></sup>. 
        I don't often get the chance to leave the house and travel with my family due to conflicting schedules<sup><b>19</b></sup>. But when 
        I do, I make sure to make the most of it<sup><b></b>20</sup>.
